                With its unique system of adaptive supply control, BitBay is creating a reliable
                currency that is truly independent. The revolutionary 'Dynamic Peg' creates both a store of value and a medium of exchange.

              <h3>The democratic control of supply</h3>
              <p>
                Every price is determined where supply meets demand. As demand constantly
                changes, we must control the supply to counteract that movement. BitBay's Dynamic Peg
                is purely decentralized, allowing every participant to vote on which direction
                the price may go. When the users collectively decide upon a price, the currency
                can then be trusted for use within BitBay's double deposit escrow contracts.
              </p>
              <p className="feature-tagline">This is the definition of a truly adaptable currency.</p>

            <div className="feature">
              <h3>A brand new method of decentralized currency management</h3>
              <p>
                Every user has two balances of $BAY, liquid and reserve. During a price crash, stakers can collectively vote to "freeze" a portion of
                the entire liquid supply. This decreases the supply and may increase the price of everyone's remaining liquid coins. The reserve coins can also be moved with
                a time delay similar to a bond which opens the door to a plethora of investment
                vehicles.
              </p>
              <p>
                During a price pump, stakers can vote to "unfreeze" a portion of the entire
                reserve supply. This increases the supply and may reduce volatility of everyone's liquid coins. Holders of the reserve coins may see a portion
                become liquid and can benefit from the conversion. The end result is a coin supply
                that elegantly adapts to current demand, no matter how much that demand changes.

                Using our tried and tested algorithm, each vote can also be algorithmically
                automated depending on user preference.

              <h3>Out with the old, in with the new</h3>
              <p>
                Historically, centralized and fixed fiat pegs tend to crumble under the pressure
                of volatility. By design, our dynamic peg requires no single entity to manage
                the supply of $BAY. BitBay's democratic voting system allows for maximum
                resilience and elasticity during extreme volatility.

              <h3>Paving the way for organic growth</h3>
              <p>
                BitBay's ecosystem requires a decentralized and adaptable cryptocurrency in
                order to thrive. This is now possible, as the dynamic peg eliminates manipulation
                from Bitcoin volatility, whales, governments, and even trigger bots. It makes room
                for adoption, and creates long-term, steady growth. When compared to an
                ever-growing list of coins, BitBay's Dynamic Peg is unlike any other.
